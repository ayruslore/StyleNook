# StyleNook

This project is a freelance project for the StyleNook company. We basically take their data and computed the scores for their stylists, so that assigning of new desgins and tasks to the stylists becomes an easier process.

After having a discussion with the stylenook owners we have calculated the base scores and the values for each task based on it's type.

The stylennok.py file contains the code for processing the data. It processes the inputs and outputs the scores in to different csv files.
